# NextClient

A minecraft utility mod written in Java aimed at anarchy servers. It was originally exclusive to a group of friends, but I'm making it public as it is discontinued and quite outdated by now.

Credits to Meteor Client for some of the code (mainly utils and mixins).

I will not be providing support for issues related to this, as it is fairly old and discontinued.

**The rewrite branch is more up to date**
